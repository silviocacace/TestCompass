# Integrations

TestCompass integrates with widely used test management and development platforms to support a smooth, traceable workflow from modelling to execution.  
Integrations ensure that generated test scenarios, decision tables, and feature files can be used directly in existing toolchains without manual rewriting.

This page explains the conceptual role of integrations and how TestCompass fits into modern development ecosystems.

## Purpose of Integrations

Integrations allow teams to:

- connect early Model-Based Testing to existing test management workflows  
- maintain traceability between requirements, models, and test execution  
- export structured test artefacts into external systems  
- support both manual and automated testing pipelines  
- collaborate across tools without losing structure or intent  

TestCompass focuses on producing **clean, structured, open artefacts** that external tools can consume reliably.

## Supported Platforms

TestCompass integrates conceptually with the following categories of tools:

### Azure DevOps
- Import generated test scenarios into Azure Test Plans  
- Use CSV exports for bulk upload  
- Link scenarios to work items for traceability  

### Jira (including Zephyr & Xray)
- Export scenarios as CSV for import into Jira-based test management plugins  
- Use Gherkin feature files for BDD workflows  
- Maintain traceability between user stories and generated tests  

### Zephyr
- Import structured test cases via CSV  
- Map generated scenarios to Zephyr test cycles  

### Xray
- Import Gherkin feature files directly  
- Use CSV for manual test case creation  
- Align model-based scenarios with Xray’s BDD and manual testing workflows  

### Other Test Management Tools
Any tool that supports:

- CSV import  
- Gherkin feature files  
- Excel-based test design  
- Decision tables  

can be used with TestCompass.

## Integration Philosophy

TestCompass follows three principles for integrations:

### 1. **Open formats**
All exports use open, text-based, tool-agnostic formats such as:

- CSV  
- Excel  
- Gherkin  
- Mermaid  

This ensures long-term compatibility and avoids vendor lock-in.

### 2. **Traceability through structure**
Because models are explicit and structured, exported artefacts retain:

- decision logic  
- expected outcomes  
- test paths  
- boundary conditions  

This makes it easy to trace a test back to the model and the underlying requirement.

### 3. **Separation of concerns**
TestCompass focuses on:

- modelling  
- reasoning  
- test generation  
- impact analysis  

Execution and reporting are delegated to the tools teams already use.

## Relationship to Export Formats

Integrations rely on the export formats provided by TestCompass.  
Each export format is designed to map cleanly to one or more external tools.

Integrations ensure that TestCompass fits naturally into existing workflows, enabling teams to benefit from early Model-Based Testing without changing their toolchain.
